WEBVTT

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.240
这里是伯克
This is Berk.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.550
它离地图太远了，几乎是一个不存在的地方
So far off the map that it might as well not exist.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.280
那我的部落？
My village?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.630
一句话：主打一个坚固
In a word, sturdy.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.150
它在这里已经孕育了几代人
It's been here for generations,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.870
但并不代表每栋建筑都很脏很旧
but every single building is new.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.600
这里的空气清新，水质清澈，
The air is crisp, the water is clean,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.360
当然这些都没什么好讲的
and the views are nothing to complain about.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.400
唯独就是有暴兽
The only downsides are the pests.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.310
你应该知道，平时大多数地方都有老鼠或蚊虫
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.620
我们有...
We have...

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.560
龙
Dragons.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.670
像这种情况大多数人都会仓皇而逃吧
Most people would leave.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.220
我们却不
Not us.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.980
因为我们是维京人
We're Vikings.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.910
我们不会逃避战斗，而是主动发起战斗
We don't run from fights. We start them.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.670
—嘿！希卡普！—晚上好
-Hey! Hiccup! -Evening.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.850
快回家！
Go home!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.300
我会马上回的，呃……
I will just as soon as I, uh...

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.750
你又挡道了！
You're in the way again!

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.100
希卡普，快装死！
Hiccup, play dead!

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.750
看到没有，龙就是
You see, dragons have been

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.270
这里最大的麻烦
a bit of a problem.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.830
你以为一只龙，好吧，哪儿哪儿都是龙。
Here and, well, everywhere.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.140
所以我们决定向他们开战。
So we decided to take the fight to them.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.830
...这对我们有什么好处？
...How's that working out for us?

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.630
额...
Eh...

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.320
-哇哦！-吊毛你在这做什么？
-Whoa! -What are you doing?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.980
这个吊毛怎么又放出来了？
What is he doing out again?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.810
快呆在其他地方去，滚蛋
Get inside. Go on.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.540
那人就是斯托伊克，
That's Stoick the Vast,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.510
部落的首领
chief of the tribe.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.540
据说，当他还是个婴儿的时候，
They say, when he was a baby,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.990
他就把龙的头直接干了下来
he popped a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.990
真的假的？
Do I believe it?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.410
哦看样子是真的 —目前我们有什么线索没？
-Yes, I do. -What have we got?

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.140
Gronckles、Nadders、Zipplebacks、Skrills（龙的种类）
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks, Skrills.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.140
今夜恐怕有点难熬
Snorti spotted a Monstrous Nightmare.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.380
看见夜煞（龙）吗？
Any Night Furies?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.700
目前还没有，酋长
None so far, Chief.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.590
行
Good.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.350
—跟我来 —好的，酋长
-Follow me. -Right, Chief.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.390
来吧，你们这些可怜虫！
Come on, you wretches!

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530
加油，干起来兄弟们儿！
You heard him. Come on, lads.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.330
哦 又溜出来了？
Oh. Out again?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.300
你当我不存在好吧
Just pretend I'm not even here.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.190
我会在你叫我走之前离开的......
I'll be in and out before you can say...

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.230
没门儿
Not so fast.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.650
求你了大哥
Come on, please.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.540
这个呆头呆脑
The meathead with attitude

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.550
有点装B还指着我的人是Gobber
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.960
拿着，走吧
Here. Go on.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.930
我从小就是他的徒弟
I've been his apprentice

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.610
我会一直盯着你
-ever since I was little. -I'm keeping my eye on you.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.090
我好像不能呆在这里吧
I'm not even supposed to be out here.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.590
哈！我又没有叫你来好吧？
Ha! Since when did that ever stop you?

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.870
守卫粮食仓库
Guard the food stores.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.870
—是的，酋长 —保护家畜
-Aye, Chief. -Protect the livestock.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.220
遵命，斯托伊克
Aye, Stoick.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.120
一定留意夜煞
And keep an ear out for Night Furies.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.890
上铁锤
Hammer.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.550
赶紧灭火！
Fire brigade!

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.240
啊，这是消防队
Ah, the fire brigade.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.140
在伯克部落里很酷的一帮爷们儿
Berk's cool kids.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.280
他们开始参与行动
They get to be out in the action.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.390
伙计们，让开！
Guys, out of the way!

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.600
但他们都是噱头
But they're nothing

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.080
不够有范儿
without their captain,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.940
不够闪耀
the shining star of our generation.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.980
要我说的话，无需任何训练就超吊的
A-Amazing without even trying.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.500
把所有烟都灭掉的那个人
The one that smokes them all.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.358
阿斯特丽德
Astrid.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.900
看什么？
What?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.690
呃…
Uh...

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.250
你不是应该在家吗？
Shouldn't you be in bed?

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.010
快点，回去做你的事
Come on, back to work.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.770
靠，我真的需要出来一下
You know, I need to get out there.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.710
让我展示下，留下我的脚印
Show my stuff, make my mark.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.290
你确实做了很多功课，但都没做对呢
You've made plenty of marks, all in the wrong places.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.470
就给我两分钟 我要干掉一条龙
Give me two minutes. I'll-I'll take down a dragon.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.024
我的人生才会有可能啊
My life will get infinitely better.

00:04:30.024 --> 00:04:31.920
你信不信我还能顺带撩到一个女朋友
I might even get a girlfriend.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.390
你身后有一只 Zippleback！
There's a Zippleback behind you!

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.820
阿斯特丽德啊？
Astrid?

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.440
但她是一位真正的维京人啊
But she's a real Viking.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.820
你不能挥动锤子
You can't wield a hammer.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.650
又不能挥动斧头
You can't swing an axe.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.480
你甚至拿不会使用任何一件武器
You can't even throw one of these.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.930
行，那我给你看这个
See, but this... this will throw it for me.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.140
—哦，又来了 ，我重新设计它了
-Oh, another one. -It's fully redesigned.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.700
这、这是……
It-it's...

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.280
—哇哦！—呼！
-Whoa! -Whew!

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.320
这是，呃...
It's, uh...

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.560
双管齐下，双杀看到没有
double-barreled.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.930
好的，这就是我所说的问题
You see, this right here... this is what I'm talking about.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.360
好吧，这只是一个轻微的校准问题
Okay, this is a mild cal... mild calibration issue.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.330
如果你真的想出去
If you ever want to get out there

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.680
与龙战斗，你必须放弃掉这一切的幼稚......
and start fighting dragons, you've got to stop all of...all of this.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.360
你刚才又向我做了这个手势
You just gestured to all of me.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.960
对啊 别把自己当多厉害的家伙
Yeah. Stop being all of you.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.680
哦...
Oh...

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.100
哦，是的
Oh, yeah.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.520
长官，您正在开一个很大的玩笑
You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.660
保持你这个态度？
Keeping this contained?

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.350
你会后悔的
There will be consequences.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.760
好吧，感谢你给我机会让我后悔
Well, I will take my chances.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.220
剑……给我磨 少废话
Sword... sharpen. Now.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.570
我相信终有一天，我会证明给大家看的
One day, I'll get out there.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.670
因为在这里杀死一条龙，你就拥有最高荣誉
Because killing a dragon is everything around here.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.370
Gronckles很强硬
Gronckles are tough.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.470
只要拿下一只一定会备受关注
Taking one down would at least get me noticed.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.610
Zippleback双头龙？
A Zippleback?

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.000
真是让人刺激又兴奋.
Exotic, exciting.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.650
两个脑袋，就是两倍的荣誉
Two heads, twice the status.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.280
砍掉Nadder的头
Lopping off a Nadder's head

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.000
一定会向他们证明我属于这里
would definitely show them I belong.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.530
加油，小伙子们！
Come on, lads!

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.250
他们（龙）要抓羊
They found the sheep.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.980
那就放手一搏
Then let loose with everything we've got.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.540
然后还有
And then there's

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.440
可怕的夜煞（龙）
the Monstrous Nightmare.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.936
重新装载！
Reload!

00:06:16.936 --> 00:06:18.810
只有最优秀的维京人才能追求最高荣誉
Only the best Vikings go after those.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.280
但最终的奖品
But the ultimate prize

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.490
是一条从来没人见过的龙
is the dragon that no one has ever seen.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.940
—我们称之为...—夜煞！
-We call it the... -Night Fury!

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.800
跳！
Jump!

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.700
狂欢之夜
And we've got a Night Fury.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.570
从不偷食物，从不现身
Never steals food, never shows itself.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.540
永不失手
And never misses.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.270
是时候让老戈伯接管了
Time for old Gobber to take over.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.510
待在这儿
Stay put here.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.310
别乱跑，我认真的
Here. I'm serious.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.410
从来没有人杀死过夜煞
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.420
开火！
Attack!

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.760
这就是为什么我要成为第一个
That's why I'm going to be the first.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.180
—又是你？快回来！我很注意你的
-You again? Get back inside! -I'll make a point of it.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.000
你这样会害死自己的，希卡普！
You're going to get yourself killed, Hiccup!

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.980
我知道！抱歉
I know! Sorry.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.920
来，把那个给我
Here, give me that.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.370
小心点！
Mind yourself!

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.100
这只Nadder仍然有攻击性
This Nadder still has some fire in it.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.140
来吧
Come on.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.680
给我个可以射击的东西 给我个可以射击的东西
Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.460
来吧，让我秀一波
Come on, show yourself.

00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:01.235
我打中了
I hit it.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.520
我打中了！
I hit it!

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.040
有人看到吗？我打中了
Did anybody see that?

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.690
你是个例外
Except for you.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.010
噢，天哪
Oh, gods.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.700
斯皮特洛，别让它逃走
Spitelout, do not let that escape.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.600
OK
Thanks a lot.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.150
你出局了
You're all out.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.910
让我们看看你还有什么招数
Let's see what else you're made of.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.750
是的，我就是这么想的
Aye, that's what I thought.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.590
哦，对了还有一件事需要了解
Oh, and there's one more thing to know.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.040
当心！
Look out!

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.220
对不起，爸爸
Sorry, Dad.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.610
小心！
Watch out!

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.970
好的，但是我遇到了夜煞
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.020
爸爸，这一次和以往任何时候都不一样
Dad, this isn't like any other time.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.520
我是说，我真的击中了一个
I mean, I really hit one.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.080
是的，一条没人见过的龙
Aye, a dragon no one's ever seen.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.150
因为它你利用夜煞作为功劳
Because it uses night as its camouflage.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.460
如果你眯起眼睛，你就会看到它遮住了星星
If you squint, you can see it blotting out the stars.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.460
—我就是这样把它击落的 —停！
-That's how I shot it down. -Stop!

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.780
停止
Stop.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.500
每次你走出去，灾难就会发生
Every time you step outside, disaster happens.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.780
你难道看不出来这是一个很大的问题吗
Can you not see that I have bigger problems?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.130
冬天快到了，
Winter is almost here,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.650
我还要养活整个村庄的人
and I have an entire village to feed.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.350
在你我之间，这个村庄可以做到
Between you and me, the village could do

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.310
喂食量少一点
with a little less feeding.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.720
这不是玩笑，希卡普！
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.690
为什么你不能遵守规则按命令作为
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.870
因为我无法阻止心中的那个自己
Because I can't stop myself.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.290
好吗？我看到一条龙，我必须……杀了它
Okay? I see a dragon, and I have to just... kill it.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.490
你知道，这...这就是我
You know, i-it's... it's who I am.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.670
儿子，你还有很多路要走
You are many things, son,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.610
但屠龙者不一定是你的人生
but a dragon killer is not one of them.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.960
回到屋子里
Get back to the house.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.920
确保他留在那里
Make sure he stays there.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.510
一个人能把事情搞砸到什么程度？
How much can one person mess up?

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.030
现在，很有可能其他人也会被赶出该岛
Anyone else would have been booted off the island by now.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.030
我猜作为酋长的儿子有其特权吧
I guess being son of the chief has its privileges.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.110
但如果不是因为酋长的话……
If not for the chief, though...

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.460
无论如何，我爸爸非常为我感到骄傲，所以......
Anyway, my dad's super proud of me, so...

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.140
爸爸，我刚才还在说……
Dad, I was just talking...

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.700
不要在公共场合跟我说话
Don't talk to me in public.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.980
你知道吗，我确实打中了一个
You know, I really did hit one.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.570
没错，希卡普
Of course you did, Hiccup.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.880
他从来不听我讲
He never listens.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.230
嗯，这是我们家的传统
Well, that runs in the family.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.510
当他这么做的时候，
And-and when he does,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.200
总是带着失望的表情，
it's always with some disappointed scowl,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.980
就像有人忘记了炖菜里最重要肉食一样
like somebody forgot the meat in the stew.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.610
我明白你的意思
I've seen that look.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.140
喂 你想的全都错了，知道吗？
Oi. You're thinking about this all wrong, eh?

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.410
重要的不是你的外表
It's not so much what you look like.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.970
他无法忍受的是你的内心
It's what's inside of you he can't stand.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.250
我谢谢你~
Thank you for summing that up.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.290
等、等一下 重点是……
W-Wait. The point is...

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.360
不要再那么努力地去成为你不该成为的人
stop trying so hard to be something you're not.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.600
我只是想成为你们中的一员
I just want to be one of you guys.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.060
我知道你会的
I know you do.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.680
没有人说过这会很容易！
No one said it would be easy!

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.130
但我提醒你们一下，
But may I remind you,

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:40.100
我们都是最优秀的龙战士后代
we are all descendants of the finest dragon fighters

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.550
维京人所到之处，
from everywhere Vikings have traveled,

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.110
维京人聚集在这里是因为他们知道
who gathered here because they knew

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.450
距离龙的巢穴
that we were within spitting distance

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.420
很近，这很关键
of a key dragon's nest.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.180
如果我们能拿下它，
If we can just take it,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.670
我们就能彻底消灭魔鬼
we can wipe out the devils for good.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.190
拿下？我们根本找不到它
Take it? We can't even find it.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.450
没错
Exactly.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.780
听到你说这个巢穴
This nest is starting to sound

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.290
像在编童话故事
more and more like a fairy tale.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.810
我们都累坏了
We're exhausted.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.320
搞得我们是需要证明什么吗，嗯？
And what do we have to show for it, eh?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.610
无需证明！
Nothing!

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.820
我们有目标
We have purpose.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.650
哦，又来
Oh, come on.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.030
我们是博克岛的战士，
We are the warriors of Berk,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.860
当太阳洒在这片土地上，我们是最顽强的部落
the roughest, toughest tribe this side of the sun.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.520
不对吗？
No?

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.380
呸
Phlegma.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.870
我们亲眼目睹你独自一人击倒了 Zippleback
We watched you take down a Zippleback singlehandedly.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.360
我的意思是，你曾经战斗中确实失去了一条腿，
I mean, sure, you lost your leg in the process,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.050
但你取得胜利了，不是吗？
but you came out on top, didn't you?

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.590
—嗯...—是的，你太棒了
-Well... -Yes, you did.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.160
雷查，你的人民来自远东
Retcha, your people came from the Far East.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.640
真菌兄，来自丝绸之路的您一路相伴
Fungi, yours all the way from-from the Silk Road.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.650
Loogi，你的人来了
Loogi, your people came

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.370
来自阳光普照的布拉兰海岸
from the sun baked coasts of Bláland.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.990
看看我们
And look at us.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.000
我们仍在这里，我们仍一直战斗
We're still here. We're still fighting.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.310
我们仍然互相照应
We're still watching each other's backs.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.180
那么我们真的要收拾行李回家吗？
So are we really gonna pack up and go home

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.870
这些血腥的野兽
while these bloody beasts

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.730
仍然在威胁我们！
are still a threat to all of our lands?

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.250
这就是我们吗？
Is that who we are?

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.120
—不 —是吗？
-No. -Is it?

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.630
—不 —是吗？！
-No. -Is it?!

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.630
不！
No!

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.910
是吗？
Is it?!

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.670
不！
No!

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.740
是吗？
Is it?

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.230
呃，不，酋长，我想不是
Uh, no, Chief, I guess not.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.370
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.860
戈蒂长老，给我们一个信号吧
Elder Gothi, give us a sign.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.875
我们有机会在冰形成之前找到巢穴吗？
Do we stand a chance of finding the nest before the ice sets in?

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.810
那么这就是我所需要的一切
Then that's all I need.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.060
我们又回到了迷雾之中
Back into the fog we go.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.410
好的，各位
All right, everyone.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.270
准备好船只！
Prepare the ships!

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.310
我们走吧！
Let's go!

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.940
当他们烧毁我们的船时，我是否应该拿起我的水桶手
Do I take my bucket hand for when they burn our ships

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.530
或者当他们沉没时我的游泳手？
or my swimming hand for when they sink them?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.260
别那么快，戈伯
Not so fast, Gobber.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.850
我没有时间训练今年的新兵，
I don't have time to train this year's recruits,

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.100
所以你就会这么做
so you'll do it.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.790
啊，古老的成年礼
Ah, the old rite of passage.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.930
小嗝嗝刚刚成年，不是吗？
Hiccup's just come of age, hasn't he?

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.030
我指的是其他人
I meant the others.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.550
是的，所以当我忙的时候，他会守着摊位
Yeah, so while I'm busy, he'll c-cover the stall.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.350
熔化的钢水，锋利的刀片，
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.530
他有很多空闲时间
lots of time on his hands.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.970
怕会出现什么问题吗？
What could possibly go wrong?

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.670
噢，我该拿他怎么办呢，戈伯？
Oh, what am I gonna do with him, Gobber?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.250
让他坚持训练
Stick him in training.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.150
不，我是认真的
No. I'm serious.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.670
是的，我也是
Yeah, so am I.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.910
这个孩子最想要的就是这个
The kid wants this more than anything.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.980
不管你信不信，
Believe it or not,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.160
那个年轻人实际上想让你感到骄傲
that young man actually wants to make you proud.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.710
但他有自己的想法
But he's got a mind of his own.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.710
从他母亲那里学的这些
Gets that from his mother.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.300
看看她最后怎么了
Look what happened to her.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.840
是的，因为瓦尔卡当时很固执
Yeah, 'cause Valka was the stubborn one.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.720
你看，以前当我还是个孩子的时候...哦，又讲这些
-See, when I was a boy... -Oh, here we go.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.070
我服从命令了 对吧？我努力了
I-I followed orders. Right? I worked hard.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.210
因为我相信维京人能够做到一切
Because I believed in what a-a Viking could do.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.350
粉碎山脉，
Crush mountains,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.140
平坦的森林，平静的海洋
level forests, tame seas.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.180
我知道我是谁，以及我必须成为什么样的人
I knew what I was and what I had to become.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.670
我儿子希卡普……他不是那样的男孩
Hiccup is... he's not that boy.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.190
他根本没机会追随我的脚步？
What chance does he have of following in my footsteps?

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.710
确实
Yeah.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.650
但你无法阻止他，斯托伊克
You can't stop him, Stoick.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.750
你只能为他做好准备
You can only prepare him.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.480
因为事实是
Because the truth is

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.650
我们不会一直在他身边保护他
we aren't always gonna be around to protect him.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.590
他会成长，他会再次溜出去的
He's gonna get out there again.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.450
他现在可能已经在外面了....
He's probably out there now.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.420
我怎么会丢掉我亲手打的龙
How could I lose an entire dragon?!

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.240
我做到了
I did it.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.520
我做到了！
I did it!

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.190
哦，你为什么还没死？
Oh, why couldn't you have been dead?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.600
现在我必须杀了你
Now I have to kill you.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.410
希卡普
Hiccup.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.240
爸爸 呃……
Dad. Uh...

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.590
爸爸，我想和你谈谈
Look, I need to talk to you, Dad.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.150
儿子，我也需要和你谈谈
I need to speak with you, too, son.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.840
我决定不
I've decided I don't want

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.000
-与龙战斗 -我想是时候了
-to fight dragons. -I think it's time

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:03.810
你学会了与龙战斗
you learn to fight dragons.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:04.780
什么？
What?

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.050
嗯，你先来
Well, you go first.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.470
不不不不不 你、你先来
No, no, no, no. You-you go first.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.950
你的愿望实现了
You get your wish.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.440
龙的试炼
Dragon training.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.230
早上开始
Start in the morning.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.620
噢，天哪，我真的应该第一个到
Oh, man, I really should've gone first.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.510
你知道，因为我在想，
You know, 'cause I-I was thinking,

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.310
我们有很多与龙搏斗的维京人，
we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.090
但是我们有足够会做面包的维京人吗？或者......
but do we have enough bread-making Vikings or...

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.520
你会需要这个
You'll need this.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.140
爸爸……我不想和龙战斗
Dad... I don't want to fight dragons.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.630
别装啦
Come on.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.320
不，你很需要
Yes, you do.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.870
不，让我重新表述一下
No, let me rephrase.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.630
我无法杀死龙
I can't kill dragons.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.260
但你会的
But you will.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.530
不，我非常肯定我不会
No, I'm very extra sure that I won't.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.610
是时候了，希卡普
It's time, Hiccup.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.370
呃……你听不到我说话吗？
Uh... can you not hear me?

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.850
你吖听不到我说话吗？！
Can you not hear me?!

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.040
火焰试炼是维京人诞生的地方
The Trial of Flame is where Vikings are made.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.460
这里是英雄的诞生地，这里是未来领袖的诞生地
Where heroes are forged, where future chiefs are born.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.220
我……我不是那种人
I... I'm none of those things.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.740
爸爸，我和你不一样
I'm not like you, Dad.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.640
听
Listen.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.750
当你拿着这把斧头时，
When you carry this axe,

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.030
你带着我们所有人
you carry all of us with you.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.890
这意味着你像我们一样同行，
Which means you walk like us,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.380
你说话像我们，你思考像我们
you talk like us, you think like us.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.280
不再有这样的事了
No more of... this.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.210
你刚才向我所有人做了手势
You just gestured to all of me.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.800
成交？
Deal?

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.440
这次谈话感觉非常一边倒
This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.870
成交不？
Deal?

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.190
成交
Deal.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.880
很棒
Good.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.400
努力训练
Train hard.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.410
我会回来的
I'll be back.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.410
也许回吧
Probably.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.760
我会在这里的
And I'll be here.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.040
也许吧
Maybe.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.950
欢迎来到火焰试炼
Welcome to the Trial of Flame.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.410
这是我们一直在等待的时刻
The moment we've all been waiting for.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.970
我只需要为我的雕像选择一个位置
I just got to pick a spot for my statue.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.970
从这里看去，它要大得多
It's so much bigger from down here.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.590
你们能相信我们真的站在这里吗？
Can you guys believe we're actually standing here?

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.910
这里是格雷比尔酋长杀死低语死神的地方
This is where Chief Greybile slew the Whispering Death.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.200
是的，这就是酋长 Tuffnut
Yeah, and it's where Chief Tuffnut

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.600
将会消灭一切
will slay everything else.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.030
-观察并学习 -伙计，我等不及了
-Watch and learn. -Man, I can't wait

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.880
获得一些传奇的战争创伤！
to get some legendary war wounds!

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.640
是的，就像我脸上被划了一道很深的伤口
Yeah, like a nasty gash right across my face.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.050
—叫我无聊...—无聊
-Call me boring... -Boring.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.570
...但我很高兴看到
...but I'm just excited to see

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.950
近距离观察一些真实的活龙
some real live dragons up close.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.030
你知道，我可以不受永久性伤害并且......
You know, I could do without the permanent injuries and...

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.790
噢，那还有什么荣耀呢？
Oh, where's the glory in that?

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.430
是啊，只有留下疤痕才有趣
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.830
我知道，对吧？
I know, right?

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.790
疼痛
Pain.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.100
爱它
Love it.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.040
哦，太好了 谁让他进来的？
Oh, great. Who let him in?

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.660
嗯，我猜爸爸一定利用了一些关系，对吧？
Mm, I guess Daddy pulled some strings, huh?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.550
你们两个在这里是不是有点老了？
Aren't you two, like, a little old to be here?

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.240
—哎哟 —等等，你说什么，小子？
-Ouch. -Wait, what did you say, whippersnapper?

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.840
你说什么？能再说一遍吗？
What did you say? Can you say it again?

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.190
没事，这的确是一个敏感的话题
Yeah, touchy subject.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.040
他们已经几次未能通过龙训练了
They've flunked dragon training a few times.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.980
嗯，实际上是四次
Um, it was four times, actually.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.780
是的，这就叫困难
Yeah, and it's called being held back.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.850
因为它太珍贵了，不能放弃
As in too valuable to let go of.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.370
真的很敏感，希卡普
Real sensitive, Hiccup.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.890
顺便说一句，名字好听
Nice name, by the way.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.650
你的名字是 Snotlout
Your name is Snotlout.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.790
确切地说
Exactly.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.930
这是一个很有男子气概的维京人名字
It's a manly Viking name.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.400
从古代文献翻译为
Translates from the ancient texts as

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.000
“打掉鼻涕的人……”
"one who beateth the snot out of a..."

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.550
住口
Shut up.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.040
让我们开始吧
Let's get started.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.900
该死的孩子们
Bloody kids.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.350
你们将是最新加入这一悠久传统的人
You are now the latest to join this time-honored tradition.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.530
我们部落里出生的每一个咬脚趾的人
Every toe biter born into our tribe

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.700
总有一天要在这个竞技场生存下来
must one day survive this arena

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.950
如果他们希望与我们并肩作战
if they ever hope to do battle alongside the rest of us.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.020
这将是艰苦的
It will be grueling.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.890
这将非常非常危险
And it will be very, very dangerous.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:19.240
但表现最好的人将赢得“顶级杀手”的称号
But whoever does best will win the title of Top Slayer.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.030
并且随之而来的是...
And with it...

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.550
随之而来的是，他们第一次杀死龙的荣誉
And with it, the honor of killing their first dragon

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.140
当着全村人的面
in front of the entire village.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.250
没有比这更大的荣耀
There is no greater glory.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.770
什么？
What?

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.600
小嗝嗝已经杀死了一只夜煞，
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.010
那么，这是否会让他失去资格或者......
so does that, like, what, disqualify him or...

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.500
哦，别理他
Oh, ignore him.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.050
你很瘦
You're skinny.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.610
你很虚弱
You're weak.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.820
这会让你不那么容易成为目标
That'll make you less of a target.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.300
他们会认为你的收获微乎其微
They'll see you as slim pickings.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.750
不值得付出努力
Not worth the effort.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.060
他们会追求更多，呃……
They'll go after the more, uh...

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.030
而是像维京人一样的青少年
Viking-like teens instead.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.410
这些门后面只是众多野兽中的一小部分
Behind these doors are just a few of the many species

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.760
你将学会战斗
you will learn to fight.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.210
致命纳德
The Deadly Nadder.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.970
攻击8，护甲16
Attack eight, armor 16.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.170
丑陋的 Zippleback
The Hideous Zippleback.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.350
加上 11 隐身，乘以 2
Plus 11 stealth, times two.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:07.940
可怕的噩梦
The Monstrous Nightmare.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.880
-火力 15 -可怕的恐怖
-Firepower 15. -The Terrible Terror.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.120
—攻击八，毒液十二！—你能停下来吗！
-Attack eight, venom 12! -Will you stop that!

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.090
你这个大毛线包
You big bag of wool.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.260
最后，是可怕的格伦克尔
And finally, the gruesome Gronckle.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.400
下颌力量八
Jaw strength eight.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.960
呃，嘿，大个子，你难道不
Uh, hey, big guy, aren't you gonna, like,

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.860
先教我们一些东西？
teach us something first?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.930
我相信在实践中学习
I believe in learning on the job.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.560
今天的主题是防守
Today is all about defense.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.660
如果你被击中，你就出局了
If you get blasted, you're out.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.420
或者，你懂的，挂掉
Or, you know, dead.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.140
那么你需要的第一件武器是什么？
So what's the first thing you're gonna need?

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.840
-盾牌！-盾牌，是的 去吧
-A shield! -Shield, yes. Go.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.590
—别挡我的路 —那是我的！
-Out of my way. -That one's mine!

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.610
盾牌是你最重要的装备
Shield is your most important piece of equipment.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.090
如果您必须在武器和盾牌之间做出选择……
If you have to choose between a weapon and a shield...

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.340
就把它放下
Just put it down.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.990
拿起盾牌
Take the shield.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.030
—给它！—我的，我的，我的！
-Give it! -Mine, mine, mine!

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.270
找到你自己的盾牌！
Find your own shield!

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.480
拉夫纳特，特夫纳特，你出局了
Ruffnut, Tuffnut, you're out.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.350
盾牌还有另一个好处：隔音
Shields are good for another thing: noise.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.150
制造足够的机会来摆脱龙的瞄准
Make plenty of it to throw off the dragon's aim.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.260
请记住，所有龙的爆发次数都是有限的
Remember, all dragons have a limited number of blasts.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.090
格伦克尔 (Gronckle) 有多少个？
How many does a Gronckle have?

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.710
哦哦！六！
Ooh, ooh! Six!

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.160
是的，六个
Six, yes.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.680
你们每个人都有一份
That's one for each of you.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.570
不过，有趣的是，
Although, interesting tidbit,

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.410
不同地区的岩石的矿物成分各有不同...
rocks from different regions vary in mineral comp...

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.510
你在做什么...你在做什么？
What are you do... What are you doing?

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.960
你在干嘛？快进来！
What are you doing? Get in there!

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.900
鱼腿子，你出局了
Fishlegs, you're out.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.760
—还剩四枪 —是的
-Four shots left. -Yeah.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.790
我俩几乎会成为全场的焦点
We're pretty much gonna be the stars of this thing.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.440
就好像我们注定要在一起一样
Almost like we were meant to be together.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.010
这是一场淘汰赛，天才
It's an elimination game, genius.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.080
顶级杀手只有一个
There's only one Top Slayer.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.500
鼻涕粗，你完了
Snotlout, you're done.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.020
三枪
Three shots.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.260
看起来就只有你和我了，是吧？
Looks like it's just you and me, huh?

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.260
不 是只有我
Nope. Just me.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.160
嘿！看着我！
Hey! Eyes on me!

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.760
是的 干得好，阿斯特丽德
Yes. Well done, Astrid.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.250
还剩两枪
Two shots left.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.760
哦，来吧
Oh, come on.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.420
希卡普，你出局了
Hiccup, you're out.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.760
—还剩一枪 —嘿，小心点！
-One shot left. -Hey, watch it!

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.840
呃呃！
Hiccup!

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.290
课程结束
End of lesson.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.610
回床上去吧，你这根长得肥大的香肠
Back to bed, you overgrown sausage.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:55.310
记住，龙永远、永远……
Remember, a dragon will always, always...

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.900
...去杀戮
...go for the kill.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.020
那么，你为什么不这么做呢？
So, why didn't you?

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.470
好的
Okay.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.490
呵呵
Huh.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.330
我们来回顾一下，好吗？
Let's review, shall we?

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.850
阿斯特丽德今天在拳击场上哪里出了问题？
Where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.480
我翻筋斗跳水的时机不对
I mistimed my somersault dive.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.360
太草率了，它打乱了我的反向翻滚动作
It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.410
-呃，是的 我们注意到了 -嘿
-Uh, yeah. We noticed. -Hey.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.930
退后，娘炮 好吗？
Back off my girl. All right?

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.640
—她正在尽力 —是的
-She's trying her best. -Yeah.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.620
别责怪自己 你会成功的
Don't beat yourself up. You'll get it.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.480
下次只要按照我的指示做就可以了
Just follow my lead next time.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.460
阿斯特丽德是对的
Astrid's right.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.560
你们必须对自己严厉一点
You've got to be tough on yourselves.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.050
只需要一个薄弱环节
All it takes is one weak link.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.090
那么你成功了？
You made it, then?

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.810
你必须开始认真对待这件事，
You got to start taking this seriously,

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.820
因为我们生活在战场上
because we are living in a battleground.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.960
如果你还没有注意到，另一方正在获胜
And in case you haven't noticed, the other side is winning.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.230
您将需要利用一切可能的优势
You're gonna need every advantage you can get.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.930
所以，如果你还没有完成作业，
So, if you haven't done your homework,

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.830
请允许我向您介绍...
allow me to present to you...

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:22.560
……《龙之书》
...the Book of Dragons.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.010
我们对每条龙的了解都以此为基础
Everything we know about every dragon we know of.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.940
你们每个部落都带来了他们的智慧
Each of your tribes brought their wisdom

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.190
并体验这些页面
and experience to these pages.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.470
这是我们最神圣的财产
It's our most hallowed possession.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.950
今晚没有龙袭击，所以要好好学习
No dragon raids tonight, so study up.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.890
你的意思是读吗？
You mean read?

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.920
我已经读过一百遍了
I've read it like a hundred times.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.360
有一个大锅，可以将沸水喷到您的脸上
There's a Scauldron that sprays your face with boiling water.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.140
然后还有，嗯，另一个...
And then there's, um, another...

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.070
我为什么要读文字
Why would I read words

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.180
当我可以杀死那些东西时，文字可以吗？
when I can just kill the stuff the words tell me stuff about?

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.850
对吧？我是说，我就是那种
Right? I mean, like, I'm the kind of guy

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.770
其他人写了关于它的文字书
that other guys write word books about.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.770
好的
Nice.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.650
—孩子们！—不过别担心
-Boys! -Don't worry, though.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.150
我来这里是为了解答您所有与龙有关的疑问，好吗？
I'm here for all of your dragon-related inquiries, okay?

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.460
理论、统计数据
Theories, stats.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.780
我甚至制作了卡片，嗯......
I've even made, um, cards, um...

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.470
你可以问我任何事情
You can ask me anything.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:14.500
—别再跟着我 —给你
-Stop following me. -Here.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.570
现在怎么样？现在就试试吧
How about now? Try me now.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.680
绝对不是
Absolutely not.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.030
所以...
So...

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.420
听起来很可怕，很恐怖，但很美好，不是吗？
sounds like a gruesome, grisly, good time, huh?

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.450
阅读它
Read it.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.460
你知道，呃……
Y-You know, uh...

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.040
也许他们并不像我们想象的那么糟糕
maybe they're not as bad as we think they are.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.840
你真的疯了吗，还是你只是表现得像那样？
Are you actually insane, or do you just act that way?

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.400
有没有...有第三种选择吗？
Is-is there... is there a third option?

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.990
我们来这里就是为了消灭龙
Wiping out dragons is why we're here.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.780
这就是我们部落最优秀的人才聚集在一起的原因
It's why the best of our tribes came together.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.030
因为龙确实和我们想象中的邪恶是一样的
Because yes, dragons are as bad as we think.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.930
是的，我知道 我只是说，
Y-Yeah, I-I know. I'm just saying,

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.750
也许我们就是问题的一部分
maybe we're part of the problem.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.790
你知道，侵入他们的土地，吃他们的食物
You know, moving in on their lands, eating their food.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.140
哇
Wow.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.250
你生活在不同的世界，不是吗？
You live in a different world, don't you?

00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:11.770
什么？
What?

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:14.220
只是顺其自然，认为一切都是理所当然的
Just coast by, taking it all for granted.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.600
嗯，我不这么认为...
Well, I don't think that...

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.860
无需为任何事努力，
Never having to work for anything,

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.210
无需费力站起来
never struggling to get a foot up.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.160
好吧，猜猜怎么着
Well, guess what.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.160
我来自虚无
I come from nothing.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.400
父亲不需要首领，不需要施舍，不需要借口
No chief for a dad, no handouts, no excuses.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.340
我不怕辛苦
I'm not afraid of hard work.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.050
我愿意尽一切努力完成这项工作，
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.810
在这种情况下，这意味着消灭龙
which, in this case, means wiping out the dragons

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:33.580
为了大家的利益
for the good of everyone.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.790
是的
Yeah.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:37.900
你还知道什么吗？
You know what else?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.760
我、我害怕...不敢问
I'm-I'm afraid... afraid to ask.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:46.490
我看中了你的那栋大房子
I've got my eye on that big house of yours.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.740
有一天我会成为酋长
I'm gonna be chief one day.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.810
我对此毫不怀疑
I-I don't doubt it.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.260
事实上，我认为我爸爸会很高兴
Actually, I think my dad would be thrilled.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.500
再说，你也是他一直希望的孩子
Besides, you're the kid he always hoped for.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.020
相反，他得到了……
Instead, he got...

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.680
这一切
all this.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.820
别挡我的路，希卡普
Stay out of my way, Hiccup.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.390
“龙的分类 ”

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.020
“打击级 恐惧级 神秘级 ”

我几乎可以闻到它们的味道
I can almost smell them.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:31.700
带我们进入海姆冥界之门
Take us in to Helheim's Gate.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.740
又来了
Here we go again.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.190
向左掌舵！
Hard to port!

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.190
向左掌舵！
Hard to port!

拨起桨！卷起船帆！
Set the oars! Furl the sails!

全部一起
All together.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.990
快点
Come on.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.820
高一点
Higher.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.150
我们并不孤单！
We're not alone!

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.770
—抬头看！—小心你的头！
-Look up! -Watch your heads!

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.170
折回！
Turn back!

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.340
它们无处不在！
They're everywhere!

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.730
嘿，我只是，呃……我刚好注意到
Hey, I just, uh... I just happened to notice

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.800
这本书没有提到夜煞
that the book had nothing on Night Furies.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.770
还有其他书吗？
Is there maybe, like, like, another book?

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.250
也许，就像《夜煞》小册子……
Maybe, like, a Night Fury pamph...

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.500
集中注意力，希卡普
Focus, Hiccup.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.640
你甚至都没尝试过
You're not even trying.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.500
今天是关于进攻的
Today is about attack.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.060
纳德行动敏捷，脚步轻盈
Nadders are quick and light on their feet.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.650
你的工作就是要更快、更轻盈
Your job is to be quicker and lighter.

00:38:35.824 --> 00:38:38.104
对不起
Sorry.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.180
我真的开始质疑你的教学方法了！
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods!

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.630
寻找它的盲点
Look for its blind spot.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.970
每条龙都有一个
Every dragon has one.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.670
找到它，藏在里面，然后攻击
Find it, hide in it, then strike.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.880
你洗过澡吗？
Do you ever bathe?

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.160
如果你不喜欢，那就去找你自己的盲点 走吧！
If you don't like it, go find your own blind spot. Go!

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.560
是的，存在盲点
Blind spot, yes.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.260
聋点，不是很多
Deaf spot, not so much.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.890
我受伤了 很多伤
I am hurt. I am very much hurt.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.440
那么，怎样才能偷偷接近夜煞呢？
So, how does one sneak up on a Night Fury?

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.100
没有人见过这样的人并能活着讲述这个故事
No one has ever met one and lived to tell the tale.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.900
—现在，进去吧！—是的，我知道
-Now, get in there! -Yeah, I-I know.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.100
我只是说，
I-I'm just saying, like,

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.420
—怎么会...—打嗝
-how would... -Hiccup.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.040
向下
Down.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.880
哇，救救你自己吧！
Whoa, save yourself!

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.120
我会处理好这件事的
I'll take care of this.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.440
哦
Oh.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.610
这不是我的错，阿斯特丽德
Not my fault, Astrid.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.440
你眼中的光芒让我分心
I got distracted by the light in your eyes.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.920
等一下！让我……
Wait! Just let me...

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.980
是的 干得好，阿斯特丽德
Yes. Well done, Astrid.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.320
没有什么比这更好的了
Nothing like giving them

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.720
自食其果，是吧？
a taste of their own medicine, eh?

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.500
还有“干得好，鼻涕粗”，
Also, "Well done, Snotlout",

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.290
“助攻”对吧？真是个好团队！
"with the assist," right? What a team!

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.850
有人认真对待此事吗？！
Is anyone taking this seriously?!

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.540
认真对待
Take it seriously.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.220
因为如果你忘了，我们父母的战争
'Cause in case you forgot, our parents' war

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.920
即将成为我们的！
is about to become ours!

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.930
弄清楚你站在哪一边
Figure out which side you're on.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.880
嗯？咦？
Hmm? Huh?

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.050
呵呵，没牙
Huh. Toothless.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.050
我敢发誓你已经……
I could've sworn you had...

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:25.880
...牙齿
...teeth.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.440
- 我-没有了
- I - don't have any more.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.570
谢谢？
Thanks?

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.100
哦，得了吧 你在开玩笑吧？
Oh, come on. You're kidding, right?

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.630
嗯
Mmm.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.770
唔？
Hmm?

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.370
然后他转身抓住我的胳膊，
And then he turned and grabbed me arm,

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.410
并且有一个转折，
and with one twist,

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.820
他把我的手全部拿下来并整个吞了下去
he took my hand clean off and he swallowed it whole.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.830
是的，他肯定已经把这个消息传开了，
Yeah, he must have spread the word around,

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.170
因为不到一个月，另一个人就夺走了我的腿
'cause within a month, another one had taken my leg.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.590
可能是 Skrill
Probably a Skrill.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.420
锯齿状牙齿，颌骨强度17
Serrated teeth, jaw strength 17.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.840
我要为你掉落的肢体报仇，大个子
I'll avenge your fallen limbs, big guy.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.390
我要砍掉你的手和脚
I'll chop off the hands and feet

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.910
——我所见到的每一条龙 ——不
-of every dragon that I see. -Nah.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.460
你想要的是翅膀和尾巴
It's the wings and the tail you want.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.430
如果它们不能飞，它们就无法逃脱
If they can't fly, they can't get away.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.230
倒下的龙就是死龙
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.200
任何人都可以不依赖其他部分而生存下去
Anyone can get by without the other bits.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.940
我将失去我的所有肢体
I'm gonna lose all of my limbs.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:44.820
我自愿让拉夫纳特失去至少一条肢体
I volunteer Ruffnut to lose at least one limb.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.890
咦？
Huh?

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.410
什么？
What?

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.640
我们是双胞胎 你的痛苦就是我的痛苦
We're twins. Your pain is my pain.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.210
你们是双胞胎吗？
You're twins?

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.380
甚至连我们的母亲都无法区分我们
Even our own mother can't tell us apart.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.420
这太不可思议了
It's uncanny.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.700
好了
There we go.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:57.730
阿斯特丽德的想法是正确的
Astrid's got the right idea.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.940
尽可能睡个好觉
Get your sleep while you can.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.460
很快，斯托伊克就会回来
Soon, Stoick will be back.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.360
你们之中的一个人将被选中去杀死那条龙
And one of you will be chosen to kill the dragon.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.500
WHO？
Who?

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:50.510
无牙！
Toothless!

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.620
早餐来啦
Brought breakfast.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.350
嗯？哥们，你觉得怎么样？
Huh? What do you think, bud?

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.970
好的
Okay.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.660
我搞到了一些鳕鱼……
We got some cod...

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.080
...一些鲑鱼
...some salmon

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.010
还有一整条熏鳗鱼
and a whole smoked eel.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.740
哇啊啊啊啊啊……
Whoa, uh, uh, uh...

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.850
没有鳗鱼！不抓鳗鱼！
No eel! Scratch the eel!

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.330
是的，呃，我也不能说我喜欢它
Yeah, I, uh, can't say I love it, either.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.790
就是这样
That's it.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:31.890
坚持做好事
Stick to the good stuff.

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:36.380
我马上就回来，
I'll just be back here,

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.970
做好我自己的事
minding my own business.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.420
好的
Okay.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.070
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.420
呼 好吧 还不错
Whew. Okay. Not bad.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.660
它应该能起到作用
It could work.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.390
如果……哇哦！好吧！
If it's... Whoa! Okay!

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.010
无牙！不行！天哪！
Toothless, no! Oh, gods!

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.050
无牙！
Toothless!

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.980
噢，天哪！
Oh, gods!

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:34.960
起作用了！
It's working!

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.750
耶！呼！
Yeah! Whoo!

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.380
耶！呼！
Yeah! Whoo!

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.730
今天的主题是团队合作
Today is all about teamwork.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:54.080
如果你们齐心协力，你们也许就能生存下来
If you work together, you might just survive.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:59.400
你看，湿了的龙头是点不着火的
You see, a wet dragon head cannot light its fire.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.090
但 Hideous Zippleback 则更加棘手，
But a Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky,

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:05.260
因为一个头吸入气体，另一个头点燃气体
'cause one head breathes gas and the other head lights it.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.890
你的工作就是知道哪个是哪个
Your job is to know which is which.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:10.130
祝你好运
Good luck.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.720
锋利的毒牙可注入毒液进行消化
Razor-sharp fangs that inject venom for predigestion.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.620
— 更喜欢保留它的受害者... — 嘘！
-Prefers to keep its victims... -Shh!

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.250
...有意识的
...conscious.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.080
你知道，我很高兴我们能够成为合作伙伴
You know, I'm kind of glad we got partnered.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.630
我们女孩必须团结在一起
Us girls got to stick together.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.670
—直到我不得不带你出去 —嘘
-Until I have to take you out. -Shush.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.760
我想我已经基本赢得了阿斯特丽德的青睐
I think I've pretty much won Astrid over.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.360
我的意思是，她几乎都不敢看我一眼
I mean, she can barely even look at me.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.230
看来你找对人了
You came to the right man for advice.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.990
-我没有问... -如果有一件事
-I didn't ask... -If there's one thing

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.440
维京女孩的大脑无法抗拒，这是......
the Viking girl brain can't resist, it's...

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.010
当心！
Look out!

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.130
—嘿！—是我们，天才
-Hey! -It's us, geniuses.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.350
闪电般的反应
Lightning reflexes.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.890
我看到丑陋的头颅，我就攻击
I see hideous heads, I strike.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.790
哎哟
Ow.

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.240
哇哦
Whoa.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.000
呃，做一个丑陋的头，阿斯特丽德
Uh, make that one hideous head, Astrid.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.420
拯救你们自己！
Save yourselves!

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.320
也以玩弄受害者而闻名
Also known to toy with its victims,

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.120
把他们肢解成碎片
dismembering them limb from limb.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.710
你能停止这样做吗？
Will you please stop that?

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:12.050
鱼腿！
Fishlegs!

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.340
搞错了
Wrong head.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.480
快离开那里，希卡普！
Get out of there, Hiccup!

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.650
哦，来吧
Oh, come on.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.010
是啊 后退！
Yeah. Back!

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:41.080
快跑……呃呃
Run... Hiccup.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.430
别让我再告诉你！是的
Don't make me tell you again! Yeah.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.880
嗯，没错 回到你的笔里
Yeah, that's right. Back in your pen.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.400
现在，想一想你做了什么
Now, think about what you've done.

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:12.530
那么，我们今天完成了吗？
So, are we done today?

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:15.740
因为今天我还有一些事情需要做，呃……
J-Just because I have some things I need to, uh...

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:19.160
是的，我要...明天去见你们
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow.

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:27.750
咦？
Huh?

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.750
嘿
Hey.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.240
哦，来吧
Oh, come on.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.690
尝试一下吧
Just try it.

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:45.600
哇哦！
Whoa!

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:47.430
噢，我要死了！
Oh, I'm gonna die!

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.430
哇哦，哇哦，不！
Whoa, whoa, no!

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.290
不，求你了！
No, please!

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:56.470
只需调整一下自己的角度
Just kind of angle yourself.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:58.680
哇哦！
Whoa!

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.240
哇哦，哇哦，不！
Whoa, whoa, no!

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.310
噢，来吧！
Oh, come on!

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.430
—让开！—走开！
-Out of my way. -Move!

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.020
动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来！
Move, move, move, move, move, move!

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.040
小心点，进入它的盲点
Watch yourselves. Get in its blind spot.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.500
我拿到了！这是我的！
I got it! It's mine!

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.130
不，别把它带过来！
No, don't bring it over here!

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.970
呃，小家伙 他叫什么名字？
Uh, little guy. What is his name again?

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:49.270
-我不记得了 -嘿，慢点
-I don't remember. -Hey. Slow down.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.180
—你是想让我们出丑吗？—不，不是
-Are you trying to show us up? -N-No.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.990
我从未见过有人能如此打败 Gronckle
I've never seen someone take down a Gronckle like that.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.820
我的意思是，我一直都这样做，但你是如何学会的呢？
I mean, I do it all the time, but how did you learn?

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.980
学什么？具体是什么？
Learn what? What exactly was that?

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.120
好的，明白了，我很乐意解释一下
Okay, see, I-I'd love to explain.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.710
只是，我把我的斧头留在了拳击场里
It's just, I left my axe back in-in the ring.

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:03.500
谁是好孩子？谁是好孩子？
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.470
哇哦，好的
Whoa, okay.

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.750
是啊，是啊？你痒吗？
Yeah, yeah? You itchy?

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.340
是那个地方吗？
Is that the spot?

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:45.650
呃呃
Hiccup.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.650
哟，他在那里
Yo, there he is.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.650
嘿，希卡普
Hey, Hiccup.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:54.380
-好的 -呃呃 WW-等一下
-Okay. -Hiccup. W-W-Wait.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.300
-我有一个合适的问题 -所以我在想......
-I have a proper question. -So I'm thinking that...

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.540
所需要的只是你和我站在拳击场上
All it needs to be is you and me in the ring.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.080
可怕的恐怖！
A Terrible Terror!

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.400
它和我的一样大...
It's like the size of my...

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:20.890
把它拿下来！
Get it off!

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.720
拿开！拿开！
Get it off! Get it off!

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.640
哎哟
Ow.

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:08.270
其他船只呢？
And the other ships?

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:21.910
爸爸！
Dad!

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:23.050
我来拿
I got it.

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.600
我很想念你
I missed you.

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.670
就像是，以一种超级男子气概
In, like, a super manly way.

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:30.160
我有很多关于火焰试炼的事情要告诉你
I got so much to tell you about the Trial of Flame.

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:32.610
基本上是...爸爸？
It's basically between... Dad?

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:35.230
爸爸？
Dad?

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.470
爸...
Da...

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:39.370
好的，我回家等你
Okay, I'll see you at home.

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:41.720
那么，没有巢穴吗？
So, no nest, then?

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.270
差远了
Not even close.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.350
我希望你能取得更大的成功
I hope you had more success.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.900
好吧，如果成功的话，
Well, if by success,

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.680
你的意思是你的育儿烦恼已经结束了，
you mean your parenting troubles are over,

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.940
那么，嗯，是的
then, uh, yeah.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.110
酋长，您听到这个消息了吗？
Did you hear the news, Chief?

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.940
—大家都松了一口气 —老希卡普终于走了
-Everyone is so relieved. -Good riddance to old Hiccup.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.530
机会
Aye.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:01.640
没有人会忽视这种麻烦
No one will miss that nuisance.

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:06.260
希卡普...
Hiccup is...

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.500
走出去了吗？
gone?

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.090
是的
Yeah.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:11.370
是的，大多数下午都是这样，但谁能责怪他呢？
Yeah, most afternoons, but who can blame him?

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.340
名人的生活可能会非常艰难
The life of a celebrity can be very rough.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.960
他几乎无法穿过村庄
He can barely walk through the village

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.830
而不会被他的大批新粉丝包围
without being swarmed by his army of new fans.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:21.900
谁能想到他有这个……
Who would've thought he has this...

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.630
和野兽相处的方式？
way with the beasts?

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:37.950
好的，伙计
All right, bud.

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.540
我们会慢慢来
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.710
开始了
Here we go.

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:44.920
位置三
Position three.

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.790
呃，不，四个
Uh, no, four.

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.250
你准备好了吗？
You ready?

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.610
来吧，来吧
Come on. Come on.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.530
是啊，看看我们！
Yeah, look at us!

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.980
哇哦！
Whoa!

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.290
我的错 我的错
My fault. My fault.

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:46.260
是的，是的，我正在做
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.710
位置五
Position five.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.330
来吧，伙计
Come on, bud.

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.000
是啊 加油，宝贝！
Yeah. Go, baby!

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.000
噢，这太神奇了！
Oh, this is amazing!

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.960
我心中的风...
The wind in my...

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.620
图纸！停！
Cheat sheet! Stop!

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.560
噢，天哪！
Oh, gods!

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.970
是的！
Yeah!

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:34.990
儿子！
Son!

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.680
爸爸！呃，你回来了
Dad! Uh, you're back.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.920
呃，呃，哦...好吧，呃，Gobber 不在这里，
Uh, uh, oh... Okay, uh, Gobber's not here,

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.060
—所以，嗯...—我知道
-so, um... -I know.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.960
来找你了
Came looking for you.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.480
你你你做了什么？呃，为什么？
You-you-you did? Uh, wh-why?

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.480
你一直在保守秘密
You've been keeping secrets.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.310
我有？
I have?

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.280
你以为你能瞒我多久？
Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.800
我甚至不知道你在说什么……
I-I don't even know what you're talking...

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:02.640
这个岛上发生的任何事我都听说过
Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:09.230
那么，我们来谈谈那条龙
So, let's talk about that dragon.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.780
噢，天哪，爸爸
Oh, gods, Dad.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.680
我-我-我真的很抱歉
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.200
我早就该告诉你了
I-I was gonna tell you sooner.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.960
— 我—只是不知道……
- I - just didn't know...

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.730
你不生气吗？
You're not upset?

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.900
啥？啥？
What? What?

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.040
我本来希望如此
I was hoping for this.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.870
— 是吗？— 哦，是的
-You were? -Oh, yes.

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:33.050
相信我，情况只会变得更好
And believe me, it only gets better.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.220
等你溢出来
Just wait till you spill

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.360
第一次感受到纳德的胆量
a Nadder's guts for the first time.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:42.470
或者，或者将你的第一个 Gronckle 头颅安装在长矛上
Or-or mount your first Gronckle head on a spear.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.510
多么奇妙的感觉啊
What a feeling.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.820
儿子，你确实让我去了那里
You really had me going there, son.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.650
那些年最糟糕的维京人
All those years of the worst Viking

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:53.030
伯克郡人所见过的
Berk has ever seen.

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:55.030
奥丁，这很艰难
Odin, it was rough.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.690
我几乎已经放弃你了
I almost gave up on you.

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:59.830
而一直以来，你都对我有所隐瞒
And all the while, you were holding out on me.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.180
全能的雷神
Thor almighty.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.460
谁会想到龙训练
Who would have thought that dragon training

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.560
本来就是你大放异彩的地方，是吧？
would have been your place to shine, huh?

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.640
啊，你甚至可能赢得“顶级杀手”称号
Ah, you might even win Top Slayer.

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.150
就像你老爸一样
Just like your old man.

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.160
谁知道呢？
Who knows?

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:16.780
你知道...
You know...

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.880
你在拳击场上表现得如此出色……
With you doing so well in the ring...

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.640
我要…我要…
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.060
—坐下 —好的

所以，我……
So, I...

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.290
哦！哦，我，呃……
Oh! Oh, I, uh...

为了……为了，呃……
To... to, uh...

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.680
保证你在拳击场内的安全

你的母亲一定希望你拥有它
Your mother would have wanted you to have it.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.760
哇哦 呃，谢谢
W-Wow. Uh, thanks.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.660
这是她胸甲的一半
It's half of her breastplate.

配套

让她...

它让她靠近你，你知道吗？
It keeps her close, you know?

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.320
儿子，自豪地穿上它
Wear it proudly, son.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.530
你已经履行了你的承诺
You've held up your end of the deal.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.680
是的
Yeah.

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.060

—明天是个重要的日子 —是的
-Big day tomorrow. -Yeah.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.330
火焰试炼，它会消耗你很多的精力
The Trial of Flame, and it takes a lot out of you.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.050
是的，火焰试炼……火焰
Yeah, Trial of Flames... Flame.

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.880
—祝你好运 —好的，谢谢你，谢谢你
-Good luck with that. -Yeah, thank you, thank you

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.990
—呃……胸帽 —我希望你喜欢……
-for the, uh... the breast hat. -I hope you like the...

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:41.620

好的，那么...晚安
Okay, well... good night.

别再耍你的花招了
No more of your tricks.

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:57.240
-我今天要参加“Top Slayer”考试 -是的，是的，好的
-I'm taking Top Slayer today. -Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:59.950
这、这都是你的了 Top-Top 尽情杀戮吧
It's-it's all yours. Top-Top Slay away.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.300
对不起
Sorry.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.010
最后一次机会 好好把握
Last chance. Make it count.

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:33.710
快点！
Come on!

01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:35.630
-加油，阿斯特丽德！你成功了！-加油，希卡普！
-Go on, Astrid! You got it! -Come on, Hiccup!

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.200
—继续！—来吧！
-Go on! -Come on!

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.410
不！
No!

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:46.030
半巨魔的儿子，吃老鼠……
Son of a half-troll, rat-eating...

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.900
很高兴看到她能优雅地处理这件事
Glad to see she's handling it gracefully.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:49.450
你！
You!

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:55.730
嗯，好的
Uh, okay.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:57.300
—稍后 —嘿，嘿 别那么急
-Later. -Hey, hey. Not so fast.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:58.790
—安静点 —不，我不能
-Quiet down. -No, I can't.

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:00.100
—我要迟到了，呃...—什么？
-I'm gonna be late for, uh... -What?

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.600
到底因为什么事迟到？
Late for what, exactly?

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.100
—再过一年……—闭嘴
-Another year... -Shut up.

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:04.520
...以及另一场火焰试炼
...and another Trial of Flame

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.090
已经结束了
has come to an end.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.680
戈蒂长老已经做出了决定
Elder Gothi has made her decision.

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:16.540
新的 Top Slayer 将是...
The new Top Slayer will be...

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.090
你成功了，希卡普
You've done it, Hiccup.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.880
你赢得了火焰试炼
You won the Trial of Flame.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.400
你要杀死那条龙
You get to kill the dragon.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.260
那是我的儿子！
That's my boy!

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:52.200
希卡普，你赢了！
Hiccup, you won!

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.690
哇！是啊
Whoa! Yeah.

01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.240
我太高兴了
Hooray me.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.970
我等不及了……
I can't wait to...

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.310
打败它并且永不回来
Beat it and never come back.

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:04.180
好了，伙计 时间到了
All right, bud. Time's up.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.110
我的想法完全一样
My thoughts exactly.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.150
你、你到底在干什么，呃……
Wh-What are you, uh...

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.120
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.010
—寻找答案 —嗯？
-Looking for answers. -Huh?

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:13.500
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.190
巴德是谁？你的教练？
Who's Bud? Your trainer?

01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:16.600
他给你穿这身衣服了吗？
Did he dress you up in this?

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.430
呃，我知道这看起来很可疑，
Uh, I-I know this looks suspicious,

01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:20.750
但有趣的是，我，呃......
but f-funnily enough, I, uh...

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.160
呃，你说得对！你说得对 我，呃……
Uh, you're right! You're right. I, uh...

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.820
我不再说谎了
I'm through with the lies.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.240
我一直在做服装，所以，嗯，你明白我的意思了
I've been making outfits, so, um, you got me.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:28.310
是时候让每个人都知道了
It's time everybody knew.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.790
带我回去就好
Just take me back.

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:31.410
哎哟！
Ow!

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:32.620
你为什么要这么做？
Why would you do that?

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.070
这都是谎言
That's for the lies.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.900
其他一切都如此
And that's for everything else.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.320
哦，不
Oh, no.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.360
快跑！快跑！
Run. Run!

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:44.810
不不不
No! No.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.630
—什么... —无牙仔，不！
-What... -Toothless, no!

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:47.950
停下来，没关系
Stop. It's okay.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.640
她是我的朋友，她是我的朋友
She's a friend. She's a friend.

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:58.030
无牙仔，阿斯特丽德 阿斯特丽德，无牙仔
Toothless, Astrid. Astrid, Toothless.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.270
那个，呃......夜煞
The, uh... the Night Fury.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.790
我不会
I wouldn't.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.800
我们死了
We're dead.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.390
嘿 你想去哪儿？
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.560
希卡普！放我下来！
Hiccup! Get me down from here!

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.580
你得给我一个解释的机会
You have to give me a chance to explain.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.020
我不听你说什么
I'm not listening to anything you have to say.

01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.840
那我就不说话了
Then I won't speak.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.880
让我们向您展示一下
Just let us show you.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.090
请吧，阿斯特丽德
Please, Astrid.

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.790
这是什么？
What is this?

01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:18.240
呃，这是我的设计
Uh, it's my design.

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.210
是的 差不多就是副队长
Yeah. Pretty much the cocaptain.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.840
那么我们就把这件事了结吧
Then let's get this over with.

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:27.910
你明白了
You got it.

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:31.220
无牙仔，我们把她打倒吧
Toothless, let's take her down.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.910
轻轻地
Gently.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.540
没什么可害怕的
Nothing to be afraid of.

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:44.820
噢，感觉真好！
Oh, nice touch!

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:50.000
我以为你是他的副队长！
I thought you were his cocaptain!

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.620
是的！这只是龙暂时故障！
I am! It's a temporary dragon malfunction!

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.280
我们制定了整个系统，记得吗？
We worked out a whole system, remember?

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.910
如果我们活下来，我就要杀了你！
If we survive, I'm gonna kill you!

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.830
现在开始旋转
And now the spinning.

01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:12.300
谢谢你，你这个没用的爬虫
Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.750
请让它停止
Please just make it stop.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.920
显然我不是掌控一切的人
I'm clearly not the one in control.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.340
那我就抱歉了！
Then I'm sorry!

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.310
无牙仔，对不起！
Toothless, I'm sorry!

01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:07.030
美好的
Fine.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.420
你说得很清楚
You made your point.

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.830
这并不能改变你明天必须杀死一个人的事实
It doesn't change the fact you have to kill one tomorrow.

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:18.940
但如果我们能改变你的想法……
But if we can change your mind...

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.600
什么？
What?

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.700
你要带大家去进行一次神奇的旅程吗？
You gonna take everyone up for a magical ride?

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.740
这并不能抹去他们对我们所做的一切，希卡普
It won't erase what they've done to us, Hiccup.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.400
它们捕猎我们，偷走我们的食物
They hunt us, steal our food.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.230
其中一个人带走了我妈妈
And one of them took my mom.

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:34.960
但我们就只能继续互相残杀吗？
But do we just keep killing one another?

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.060
相对于...？
As opposed to...?

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.270
我不知道
I-I don't know.

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:44.280
但是你搞砸了我们的逃跑计划，所以我需要一点时间
But you botched our escape plan, so I'm gonna need a minute.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.630
好吧，我可能不会告发你
Well, I might not snitch on you.

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.010
我们也许不会把你扔进海里
And we might not drop you in the sea.

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:01.850
巴德？怎么了？
Bud? What's up?

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.300
它是什么？
What is it?

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:06.090
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:08.130
下来！
Get down!

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:13.860
无牙仔，带我们离开这里
Toothless, get us out of here.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:22.000
看起来他们正在拖运猎物
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.280
那我们又是什么呢？
Then what does that make us?

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.420
龙巢
The dragons' nest.

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:05.840
噢，我爸爸愿意付出一切来找到这个
Oh, what my dad wouldn't give to find this.

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:41.260
那是什么？
What is that?

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.880
好了，伙计，该走了
All right, bud, time to go.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.480
我不敢相信花了这么长时间才弄明白
I can't believe it took this long to figure it out.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.830
现在一切都说得通了
It all makes sense now.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.310
它就像一个巨大的蜂巢
It's like a giant beehive.

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:04.800
它们是工人，那是它们的女王
They're the workers, and that's their queen.

01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.070
他们的阿尔法
Their alpha.

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:07.730
它控制着它们
It controls them.

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:09.280
我们得找到你的爸爸
We got to find your dad.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.910
不，不，不，还没有
No, no, no, not yet.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.220
他们会……他们会杀死无牙仔
They'll... they'll kill Toothless.

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:19.950
阿斯特丽德，我们必须仔细考虑一下这件事
Astrid, we have to think this through carefully.

01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:25.750
希卡普，我们刚刚发现了龙巢，
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest,

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:27.990
你想保守这个秘密吗？
and you want to keep it a secret?

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:30.580
为了保护你的宠物龙？
To protect your pet dragon?

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:33.480
你是认真的？
Are you serious?

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.930
是的
Yes.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.870
好的
Okay.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.700
那么...我们该怎么办？
Then... what do we do?

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:56.470
到明天为止
Just give me until tomorrow.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.470
我会想办法的
I'll figure it out.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:02.500
那是绑架我
That's for kidnapping me.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:05.440
嘿，你要...
Hey, are you gonna...

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.140
其他一切都如此
And that's for everything else.

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:23.670
什么？
What?

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:38.510
好吧，我终于可以再次在公众面前露面了
Well, I can finally show my face in public again.

01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:44.340
好的
All right.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.240
如果有人在短短几周内告诉我，
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks,

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:53.150
希卡普 (Hiccup) 就不再是希卡普了……
Hiccup would've gone from being, well, Hiccup...

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.530
...在火焰试炼中获得第一名，
...to placing first in the Trial of Flame,

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:00.390
我的意思是，我会把它们绑在桅杆上
I mean, I would've tied them to a mast

01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:03.470
并把他们送走，因为担心他们会发疯
and shipped them off for fear they'd gone mad.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.190
你知道的
And you know it.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.270
但我们就在这儿
But here we are.

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:16.580
我的儿子赢得了“顶级杀手”的称号
My son has won the title of Top Slayer.

01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:20.350
没有人比他更惊讶...
No one is more surprised...

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:26.250
...或者比我更自豪
...or more proud than I am.

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:32.560
今天，我的儿子成为一名战士
Today, my boy becomes a warrior.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:37.430
今天，他成为了我们中的一员！
Today, he becomes one of us!

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:40.430
是的！
Yeah!

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:42.260
是的！
Yeah!

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.540
是的！
Yeah!

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:46.890
是的！
Yeah!

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:49.550
嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:52.270
嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:55.900
嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.010
嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.660
嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.420
呃呃！呃呃！
Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.050
小心那条龙
Watch out for that dragon.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.570
我担心的不是那条龙
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:15.260
听着，我要试着结束这一切，
Look, I'm gonna try to put an end to all this,

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.130
但如果那里出了问题，那就……
but if something goes wrong in there, just...

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:20.470
不要参与
don't get involved.

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:22.960
我爸爸太尊重你了
My dad respects you too much.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.970
是的
Yeah.

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:31.760
但...
But...

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.070
你有我没有的东西
you have something I don't.

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:38.320
这是我们谁都没有的东西
Something none of us have.

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:44.190
所以...我会支持你，
So... I'm going to stand by you,

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:45.980
无论发生什么
come what may.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.610
无论发生什么
Come what may.

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:53.890
是时候了，希卡普
It's time, Hiccup.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.620
把他打死吧，儿子
Knock him dead, son.

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:13.040
嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:16.880
嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:19.640
嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.370
嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.820
呃呃！呃呃！
Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:28.370
嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:29.880
加油，希卡普！
Go, Hiccup!

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.820
把我教你的一切都展示给他们看！
Show 'em everything I taught you!

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.200
应该是我
Should've been me.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.410
呼 还好吗？
Whew. All right?

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:38.380
人群很拥挤，不是吗？
Good crowd, isn't it?

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.420
呃呃！呃呃！
Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:44.280
嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！嗝！
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:59.500
我会用锤子
I would have gone with the hammer.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.990
只是，只是给他一个机会
Just-just give him a chance.

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.000
我准备好了
I'm ready.

01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.650
他在做什么？
What is he doing?

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:22.790
我不会伤害你的
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.010
我不是他们中的一员
I'm not one of them.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.650
—停止战斗 —不
-Stop the fight. -No.

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.820
你们都需要看看这个
You all need to see this.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.960
它们并不是我们想象的那样
They're not what we think they are.

01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:56.930
我们没必要杀死他们
We don't have to kill them.

01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:00.830
我说了停止打架！
I said stop the fight!

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.260
走开！
Out of my way!

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:11.670
快离开那里，希卡普！
Get out of there, Hiccup!

01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:14.920
呃呃！
Hiccup!

01:23:34.730 --> 01:23:35.960
快，快！抓住他的手！
Quick, quick! Grab his hand!

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.520
—爬上来 —希卡普，抓住我的手！
-Climb up. -Hiccup, grab my hand!

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.270
—上来！—快点！
-Get up here! -Hurry up!

01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:40.440
快过来！抓住他的手！
Get over here, man! Just grab his hand!

01:23:48.810 --> 01:23:51.540
阿斯特丽德，回来！
Astrid, get back here!

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.470
这是命令！
That's an order!

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.340
跑步！
Run!

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.140
快点
Come on.

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.280
呃呃！
Hiccup!

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:21.600
夜煞
Night Fury.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.540
—夜煞！—他是真实存在的！
-Night Fury! -He's real!

01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:54.740
好的，伙计 继续吧 走吧
All right, bud. Go on. Go.

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:59.500
快，快！到他身边去！
Go, go! Get to the side of him!

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.440
走开，希卡普！
Get out of the way, Hiccup!

01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:10.290
不，停下来 你只会让事情变得更糟！
No, stop. You're only making it worse!

01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:13.620
阿斯特丽德！
Astrid!

01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:19.140
我知道了 走吧！
I got it. Go!

01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:22.770
斯托伊克，他不会伤害你的
Stoick, he won't hurt you.

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:34.780
不！
No!

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.790
无牙！
Toothless!

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.060
不
Don't.

01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:48.550
把它拿下来！
Take it down!

01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:50.450
抓住它的腿！
Grab its legs!

01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:51.970
—按住！—不！
-Hold it down! -No!

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:54.630
—不，别伤害他！—退后！
-No, don't hurt him! -Stay back!

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.500
你呢...
And you...

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.060
把它和其他的放在一起
Put it with the others.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.640
—我早该知道的！—爸爸
-I should have known! -Dad.

01:26:24.730 --> 01:26:26.160
—我应该看到这些迹象的 —爸爸！
-I should have seen the signs. -Dad!

01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:27.280
我们达成协议了！
We had a deal!

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.010
我知道，但那是以前……
I-I know, but that was before...

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.900
一切都太混乱了
It's all so messed up.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.290
那么，戒指里的一切，究竟是诡计？谎言？
So everything in the ring, what, a-a trick? A lie?

01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:37.530
不，我早就应该告诉你
No, I-I should have told you before now.

01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:39.470
把这事发泄在我身上吧……这是我的错……
Take that out on me... it's my fault...

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.780
但请不要伤害无牙仔
but please don't hurt Toothless.

01:26:42.850 --> 01:26:44.820
龙？
The dragon?

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.230
这就是你所担心的吗？
That's what you're worried about?

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.300
不是那些你差点杀死的人吗？
Not the people you almost killed?

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.550
他不危险 他、他在保护我
He's not dangerous. He-he was protecting me.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.340
老天爷啊，他们把你母亲带走了！
They took your mother, for gods' sake!

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.860
如果她能看到你现在和他们站在那里
If she could see you now standing there with them

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.900
他们已经杀害了我们数百人
when they've killed hundreds of us.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.560
我们已经杀死了数千只！
And we've killed thousands of them!

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.240
他们为自己辩护
They defend themselves.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.560
就这样
That's all.

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.050
他们袭击我们是因为他们不得不这么做
They raid us because they have to.

01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.520
如果他们没有带回足够的食物，
If they don't bring enough food back,

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.980
它们自己也会被吃掉
they'll be eaten themselves.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.880
他们的岛上还有其他东西
There's something else on their island.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.570
我从未见过这样的龙
A dragon like I've never seen.

01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:16.470
他们的岛屿？
Their island?

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.880
你已经去过巢穴了
You've been to the nest.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:22.270
我说过巢穴吗？
Did I say nest?

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.230
你是怎么找到它的？
How did you find it?

01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:26.170
我没有，无牙仔有
I didn't. Toothless did.

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:28.890
只有龙才能找到这个岛
Only a dragon can find the island.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.690
不，爸爸，不
No. Dad, no.

01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:36.230
你不知道自己面对的是什么
You don't know what you're up against.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.630
这和你以前见过的完全不一样
This is nothing like you've ever seen.

01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:40.350
你不可能赢得这场胜利
You can't win this one.

01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:42.150
在你的一生中，你能不能
For once in your life, would you please

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.830
听我说完？
just listen to me?

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:50.950
你已经把你的命运和他们联系在一起了
You've thrown your lot in with them.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.400
你不是我们中的一员
You're not one of us.

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.650
你不是我的儿子
You're not my son.

01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:07.170
准备好船只！
Ready the ships!

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:09.800
黎明即起航！
We sail at dawn!

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.550
冲锋在前线！
Forward on the leading line!

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:41.830
稍微向外摆动
Swing it out slightly.

01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:43.550
她来了 轻松
Here she comes. Easy.

01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:45.630
小心头部
Careful with the head.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.210
哦，现在要小心了
Oh, careful now.

01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:50.220
武器已上膛！
Weapons loaded!

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:52.010
船上有备用索具吗？
Spare rigging aboard?

01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:54.220
—是的 —扬帆起航！
-Aye. -Hoist the sails!

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.950
好的，酋长
Aye, Chief.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.020
—准备好桨 —是的，斯托伊克
-Ready the oars. -Aye, Stoick.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.370
我们启航前往冥界之门！
We set sail for Helheim's Gate!

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.530
带我们回家吧，魔鬼
Lead us home, devil.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.800
我试图阻止他们
I tried to stop them.

01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:00.180
我最终给了他们他们想要的东西
I ended up giving them exactly what they wanted.

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.670
我应该只是...
I should've just...

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:08.540
当我在树林里发现他时我就应该杀了他
I should've killed him when I found him in those woods.

01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:12.780
这对于每个人来说都会更好
It would have been better for everyone.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.230
是的
Yeah.

01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:16.370
我们其他人也会这么做的
The rest of us would have done it.

01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:20.580
那么，你为什么不这么做呢？
So, why didn't you?

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:22.790
—你为什么不呢？—我不知道
-Why didn't you? -I don't know.

01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:24.430
—我不能 —这不是答案
-I-I couldn't. -That's not an answer.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.160
为什么这对你来说突然变得如此重要？
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.280
因为我想记住你现在说的话
Because I want to remember what you say right now.

01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:30.280
为了爱...因为我很软弱
For the love of... Because I was weak.

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.060
因为我是个懦夫，因为我不会
Because I was a coward, because I wouldn't

01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:33.720
—杀死一条龙 —你当时说的是“不会”
-kill a dragon. -You said "wouldn't" that time.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.560
随便！我不会！
Whatever! I wouldn't!

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.190
我是第一个维京人，谁知道多久了
I'm the first Viking in who knows how long

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.740
谁不会杀死一条龙呢？
who wouldn't kill a dragon.

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:44.470
不过，我是第一个骑的
First to ride one, though.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.200
所以？
So?

01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.410
我不会杀他因为......
I wouldn't kill him because...

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.900
......他看上去和我一样害怕
...he looked just as frightened as I was.

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.180
当我看着他时...
When I looked at him...

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.460
我看到了我自己
I saw myself.

01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:21.640
我敢打赌他现在真的害怕了
Bet he's really frightened now.

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.960
你要做什么呢？
What are you gonna do about it?

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.550
出色地
Eh.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.070
可能是做了一些愚蠢的事情
Probably something stupid.

01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:35.900
唔
Hmm.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.870
嗯，你已经这样做了
Well, you've already done that.

01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:44.800
然后发生了一些疯狂的事情
Then something crazy.

01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:48.500
这才像样
That's more like it.

01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:55.780
表明你的立场
Sound your positions.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.540
保持在听力范围内
Stay within earshot.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.990
到船尾有一长度
One length to your stern.

01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:02.370
在你的右舷
On your starboard flank.

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:04.580
他们为什么不进攻？
Why aren't they attacking?

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.960
也许他们知道一些我们不知道的事情
Maybe they know something we don't.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.730
你只是一个自讨苦吃的人吗？
Are you just a glutton for punishment or what?

01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:14.660
这次我们有机会奋起反抗

感谢 Hiccup

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.240
你认为我们还要多久...
How long do you think we're gonna...

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.840
嘘
Shh.

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.270
让开，德吕尔
Step aside, Drül.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:52.420

01:33:05.610 --> 01:33:07.400
好的，等一下

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:10.890
你简直是在全村人面前丢脸
You just disgraced yourself in front of the whole village.

01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:13.100
—我们为什么要听你的？—因为我这么说
-Why would we listen to you? -'Cause I said so.

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.310

听着，我爸爸的本意是好的，但他很固执
Look, my dad means well, but he's stubborn.

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.000
他即将陷入困境，
And he's about to be way in over his head,

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.140
所以这取决于我们
so it's up to us.

01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:22.660
我们？

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.660
如果没有你们，我不可能完成这个任务

你有狂野的一面，我喜欢这一点

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.510
究竟带领我们去往何方？
Lead us where exactly?

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.100
他们乘坐我们所有的船离开了
They left with every ship we have.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.030
跟着我

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.660
哦
Oh.

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:55.140
事情就是这样发生的
That's where that went.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.970
保持低调 做好准备
Stay low. Be ready.

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.560

不，嗯嗯

希卡普，我……

01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:03.240
放松
Relax.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.110
没关系
It's okay.

01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:19.570
呃，你要去哪儿？
Uh, where are you going?

准备
Get ready.

01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:26.030

组成防线
Form a defensive line.

01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:43.250

今天我们摧毁

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.420
一劳永逸地结束龙的统治

不管怎样，它就在这里结束，就在此刻！
However this ends, it ends right here, right now!

01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:25.080
所以让我们把这些魔鬼送回地狱吧！
So let's send these devils back to hell!

01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:44.720
就这样吗？
Is that it?

01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:46.060
这个窝是我们的！
The nest is ours!

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:52.100

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:54.090
自从你离开后，发生了一些变化
A few changes since you've been out.

01:54:54.230 --> 01:54:57.850
我告诉你，飞回这里真是一次相当不错的经历
Flying back here was, uh, quite an experience, let me tell you.

01:54:57.990 --> 01:55:00.610
等等，等等，你……你骑着龙？
Wait, wait, you... you rode a dragon?

01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:02.100
嗯...嗯，那只怪物被烧死了
Well... well, that monster burned

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.750
我们所有的船，所以我们并没有
all of our ships, so we didn't really

01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:05.290
— 有很多... — 打嗝！
-have much of a... -Hiccup!

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.690
哦，不
Oh, no.

01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:08.690
这次我做了什么？
What'd I do this time?

01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:09.760
哎哟！
Ow!

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.450
那是为了吓唬我
That's for scaring me.

01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:13.900
好吧，会一直这样吗？因为……
Okay, is it always gonna be like this? 'Cause...

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:19.250
其他一切都如此
And that's for everything else.

01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:22.150
你知道，因为......因为我......我可以习惯这一点
You know, 'cause... 'cause I... I-I could get used to that.

01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:23.880
是的
Yep.

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:28.990
事实证明，我们所需要的只是多一点这样的事
Turns out all we needed was a little more of this.

01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:31.610
你刚才向我所有人做了手势
You just gestured to all of me.

01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:34.720
嗯，你们大多数人都知道
Well, you know, most of you.

01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:37.030
新的腿是我亲手做的，只需轻轻一划
New leg is my handiwork with just a dash

01:55:37.170 --> 01:55:39.650
充分展现你的古怪天赋
of your kooky flair thrown in for good measure.

01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:40.830
开始了
Here we go.

01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.340
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:43.760
—你重建了它？—是的
-You rebuilt it? -Yeah.

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:45.660
我找到了你的设计
I found your designs.

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.280
还不错
Not too bad.

01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:49.490
夜煞！
Night Fury!

01:55:49.630 --> 01:55:51.630
—他在这儿 —怎么了？
-Here he is. -What is it?

01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:53.320
那是什么啊？
What is it, huh?

01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.630
想尝试一下吗？
Want to take it for a spin?

01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:08.820
这是伯克
This is Berk.

01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:12.820
搬到这里来你一定是疯了
You'd have to be crazy to move here.

01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.620
留下来就更疯狂了
Even crazier to stay.

01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:21.250
这不适合胆小的人
It's not for the faint of heart.

01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:26.560
哇喔！
Whoo!

01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.490
任何生长在这里的食物
Any food that grows here

01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:30.840
又硬又没味
is tough and tasteless.

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:32.500
快点！
Come on!

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.190
在这里成长的人们……
The people that grow here...

01:56:34.330 --> 01:56:35.980
-哇哦！-...甚至更是如此
-Whoa! -...are even more so.

01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:43.300
唯一的好处就是有宠物
The only upsides are the pets.

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.750
而其他地方可能有小马或小狗……
While other places may have ponies or puppies...

01:56:46.890 --> 01:56:50.100
—来吧，伙计 —……我们有……
-Come on, bud. -...we have...

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.620
...龙
...dragons.
